# Exercise Developed on Eduzz` Bootcamp by DIO

As proposed, for the first exercise, I've created a code that compares two strings and check if they are equal by riding from back to front.
The second one replaces the even numbers, in an array, to zero, if the input is a empty string, that returns -1.
